# Solitaire
A simple Solitaire card game made in Unity 2021 LTS using Model-View-Presenter architecture, dependency injection, reactive and asynchronous programming. I used Unity UI and TextMeshPro for the UI of the game and the animations are done with tweening. The game's logic is covered with Unit tests.

**Unity packages:**
* 2D Sprite
* Unity UI
* TextMeshPro
* Test Framework
* Advertisement

**3rd party plugins:**
* Zenject / Extenject
* UniRx
* UniTask
* DOTween
* NSubstitute
